Universal Raspberry Pi GPIO keyboard daemon

note for mfg92 fork:
I have added the possibility to skip the mouse initialisation of the uinput part. Use the new '-smi' flag. I have added this possibility because i did not need a mouse/joystick over GPIO and otherwise an unused cursor apeared in my application.
